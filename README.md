cluster and map https://arxiv.org/ into knowledge domains using api provided 
Ideally we would like to use a BERT model to convert each document, e.g. paper abstracts into vector embedding for coherence amongst papers,
as well as how frequently research papers cite one another to further tighten clusters. 
Ideally we would like to build these models from scratch as to further the reward and learning.
